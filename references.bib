Most research to date has approached person–environment fit as a static phenomenon, and without examining how different types of person–environment fit may affect each other. In particular, little is known about the conditions under which fit with one aspect of the environment influences another aspect, as well as subsequent behavior. To address this gap we examine the role of leader–member exchange in the relationship between two types of person–environment fit over time: person–organization and person–job fit, and subsequent turnover. Using data from two waves (T1 and T2, respectively) and turnover data collected two years later (T3) from a sample of 160 employees working in an elderly care organization in the Netherlands, we find that person–organization fit at T1 is positively associated with person–job fit at T2, but only for employees in high-quality leader–member exchange relationships. Higher needs–supplies fit at T2 is associated with lower turnover at T3. In contrast, among employees in high-quality leader–member exchange relationships, the demands–abilities dimension of person–job fit at T2 is associated with higher turnover at T3. }

A search of published articles, conference presentations, dissertations, and working papers yielded 172 usable studies with 836 effect sizes. Nearly all of the credibility intervals did not include 0, indicating the broad generalizability of the relationships across situations. Various ways in which fit was conceptualized and measured, as well as issues of study design, were examined as moderators to these relationships in studies of PJ and PO fit. Interrelationships between the various types of fit are also meta‐analyzed. 25 studies using polynomial regression as an analytic technique are reviewed separately, because of their unique approach to assessing fit. Broad themes emerging from the results are discussed to generate the implications for future research on fit.},

	abstract = {Background: Psychiatric nurses need to keep close contact with patients suffering from mental illness. Because of the special nature of their profession, there is an increasing incidence of job burnout among psychiatric nurses. Aim: This study examined the relationship between psychiatric nurses’ perceived organizational support, job burnout, and psychological capital. It also investigated the mediating role of psychological capital in the relationship between their perceived organizational support and job burnout.
Methods: A total of 916 psychiatric nurses were recruited from 6 grade-III mental facilities in Shandong Province using the stratified sampling approach. Their data were collected and examined using a general demographic data questionnaire, The Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Perceived Organizational Support Scale, and the Psychological Capital Questionnaire.
Results: The total score of job burnout was 53.71 ± 16.37. Specifically, 73.69\% of the nurses had moderate to severe emotional exhaustion, 76.75\% had moderate to severe job burnout pertaining to depersonalization, and 98.80\% had moderate to severe job burnout pertaining to personal accomplishment. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that both psychological capital (r = −0.35, p {\textless} 0.01) and perceived organizational support (r = −0.31, p {\textless} 0.01) were adversely related to job burnout. Additionally, psychological capital somewhat mediated the relationship between perceived organizational support and job burnout. Its mediating impact accounted for 33.20\% of the overall effect.
Conclusion: This study’s participants had a moderate to severe level of job burnout. However, organizational support and psychological capital can be crucial in alleviating this problem among psychiatric nurses. Therefore, nursing managers and medical institutions should undertake timely and positive interventions to improve psychiatric nurses’ mental health and prevent job burnout. While exploring the impact of organizational support and psychological capital on job burnout, future studies should consider other effective influencing factors, and the relationship between the different factors should be explored in depth. This would provide a basis for developing a job burnout prevention mechanism.},

              s of 238, 102, and 981) in order to examine relations among various types of underemployment, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions. Each dimension of underemployment is explored as a case of poor person‐job fit, and the fit literature is used to produce hypotheses about these relations. We also developed and validated the 9‐item Scale of Perceived Overqualification (SPOQ) to tap employee perceptions of surplus education, experience, and KSAs (knowledge, skills, and abilities). In general, perceptions of underemployment were associated with poor job satisfaction, particularly for facets with a direct causal relationship with the specific dimension of underemployment, such as overqualification and satisfaction with work. Perceived overqualification was also related to lower affective commitment, and higher intentions to turnover. For part‐time work, negative attitudes were only found when employees expressed a preference for full‐time work; a similar trend was not found for temporary workers, however. Implications for theory, research, and practice are delineated. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

More activated forms of well-being were proposed to be associated with poorer, rather than better, want–actual fit, since greater motivation raises wanted levels of job features and may thus reduce fit with actual levels. As predicted, activated well-being (illustrated by job engagement) and more quiescent well-being (here, job satisfaction) were found to be associated with poor fit in opposite directions—positively and negatively, respectively.

We collected data among a heterogeneous group of employees (N = 114) during three consecutive weeks (N = 430 occasions). At the end of their working week, employees reported their job crafting behaviors, their person–job ﬁt (demands–abilities ﬁt and needs–supplies ﬁt), and the meaningfulness of their work that week. Results indicated that individuals who crafted their job by increasing their job resources (e.g., support, autonomy) and challenging job demands (e.g., participate in new projects), and by decreasing their hindering job demands (e.g., less emotional job demands) reported higher levels of person–job ﬁt the next week. In turn, demands–abilities ﬁt related to more meaningfulness in the ﬁnal week. No support was found for alternative causal models. These ﬁndings suggest that by crafting their job demands and job resources, individuals can proactively optimize their person–job ﬁt and as a consequence experience their work as meaningful.},

	abstract = {Job performance of employees and stress at work are very common problems in today’s business world. Many people change their jobs due to high job stress which affects their personal well-being. High stress can be result of incompatibility between the person performing the job and the job’s requirements. This can exacerbate feelings of stress on the job and in an employee’s personal life. Whilst employees can be reasonably expected to adjust to changes in jobs over time, poor job or employee job fit can result in increased stress and inefficiency in organizations. To combat this we surmise that through careful attention to person-organization fit during the interview or assessment phase, organizations can select employees who are adaptable to change and who can work efficiently to avoid the negative effects of high stress caused by person job incompatibility. In this study we aimed to examine in detail the effects of person-job fit and the importance of person-organization fit in order to allow organizations to prevent the high cost of employees poorly suited to their jobs. The research indicates that organizations whose employees are suited to their jobs operate with greater efficiency and adapt to change more smoothly than those whose employees do not fit their jobs. The study also aims to investigate if perceived person-organization fit mediates the relationship between person-job fit and job stress. The results of the study demonstrate that paying careful attention to person-job fit and adjusting employees to the organization are essential factors for decreasing job stress.},

This study utilizes this perspective to analyze China's eco-innovation mode in response to climate change. By categorizing eco-innovation into radical and incremental eco-innovation, we examine the relationship between these concepts using Y02 patents as a proxy and panel data from 30 Chinese provinces from 2004 to 2015. The results show that eco-innovation as a whole as well as both radical and incremental innovations are drivers for reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, contradictory to most previous empirical results related to the complementarity hypothesis, we ﬁnd a complementary relationship between radical and incremental eco-innovation. These results collectively represent China's unique eco-innovation mode, conﬁrming the assumed diversity of eco-innovation models in different contexts. The results also show the signiﬁcant positive effects of economic development, urbanization level, industrial structure, and China's opening up on carbon emissions, indicating that economic and social development have not yet been completely dissociated from carbon emissions in China.},
